Users
------------------------
If you are in a system which understands POSIX and has the GNU toolkit, you
probably can run:
 make
 make install

If you want to install to another path than /usr/local, you can run:
 make install PREFIX=/usr


Developers
------------------------
Run ". setenv" before adding bugs to the database.
Use 'bug' for the database.  http://freshmeat.net/projects/bug/
